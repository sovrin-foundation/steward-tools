Use genesis_from_files.py to greate genesis files (domain and pool) for a validator
pool. The values of the keys, names, etc. can be completely arbitrary, so this
utility is useful for creating genesis files for actual, rather than test pools
with fixed keys and names.

This script must be run on a system that has the indy-node package installed on it,
for instance, on a validator node.

It requires 2 CSV files as inputs, one containing trustee information for the new
pool, and one containing steward information, including validator node data. The
format of the contents required in the files is as indicated in the output of 
"genesis_from_files.py -h"
